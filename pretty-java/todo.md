## Objective
Refactor the PrettyStyle library to improve code organization, reduce duplication, and enhance maintainability while preserving functionality. Focus on separation of concerns, clean API design, and following Java best practices.

## Background
PrettyStyle is a console styling library that provides ANSI color and formatting capabilities. It currently has code duplication and mixing of styling and layout concerns. The goal is to create a more modular and maintainable structure.

## Component Overview

### Core Components
- **PrettyStyle**: Provides ANSI color and formatting capabilities
- **core.file**: File handling with styling (PrettyFile, PrettyFileConcept, PrettyFileTreeNode)
- **core.stream**: Custom PrintStream with styling (PrettyPrintStream)
- **format.layout**: Layout-related functionality
- **utils**: Utility classes including TerminalUtils and FileUtils

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Separate styling from layout components
- Move styling functionality to appropriate style-focused classes
- Move layout functionality to format/layout package
- Create clean interfaces between styling and layout

### 2. Reorganize package structure
- Establish consistent naming conventions
- Organize core styling in a dedicated package
- Structure format packages logically
- Ensure proper package dependencies

### 3. Integrate core.file package
- Position PrettyFile components properly in architecture
- Review and optimize PrettyFileConcept functionality
- Integrate PrettyFileTreeNode with layout components

### 4. Integrate core.stream package
- Ensure PrettyPrintStream follows Java I/O best practices
- Make PrettyPrintStream consistent with other components
- Optimize stream functionality

### 5. Eliminate duplicated terminal detection
- Consolidate terminal detection in TerminalUtils
- Remove duplicate detection logic from other classes
- Create a simple API for capability checking

### 6. Consolidate color implementations
- Unify RGB and 256-color implementations
- Establish consistent color handling approach
- Optimize color selection for different terminal types

### 7. Implement shared abstractions
- Create base interfaces/classes for common functionality
- Apply composition over inheritance
- Define clear responsibilities for each component

### 8. Create fluent API for styles
- Implement builder-style fluent interfaces
- Add convenience methods for common style combinations
- Ensure method naming consistency

### 9. Implement proper object methods
- Add toString(), equals(), and hashCode() implementations
- Ensure proper immutability where appropriate
- Address null safety concerns

### 10. Add comprehensive JavaDoc
- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Provide migration guidance for breaking changes

### 11. Update unit tests
- Align tests with new structure
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure high test coverage

## Best Practices to Follow
1. Single Responsibility Principle - each class should have only one reason to change
2. Open/Closed Principle - open for extension, closed for modification
3. Interface Segregation - smaller, focused interfaces over large general ones
4. Dependency Inversion - depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
5. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - avoid duplication of code and knowledge
6. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - only implement what's currently needed
7. Consistent naming conventions
8. Proper encapsulation
9. Immutable objects where appropriate
10. Null safety throughout the codebase

## Constraints
- All existing functionality must be preserved
- Public API changes should be minimal and well-documented
- Unit tests must pass after refactoring
- Code must work on all currently supported platforms
- File operations must remain backward compatible
