# Changes Made to Satisfy TODO #2: Reorganize package structure with proper hierarchy

## Overview
The second TODO item in the refactoring plan was to reorganize the package structure with proper hierarchy. This has been implemented by:

1. Establishing consistent naming conventions across the codebase
2. Organizing core styling components in a dedicated package
3. Structuring format packages logically
4. Ensuring proper package dependencies

## Package Structure Changes

### Main Entry Points
- Created `Pretty` class as the main entry point for formatters
- Created `PrettyConsole` class as the main entry point for styling
- Moved styling functionality from `PrettyStyle` to `PrettyConsole` and the `style` package

### API Package
- Kept the API interfaces in the `api` package
- Ensured clean interfaces between API and implementation

### Format Package
- Organized format implementations into logical subpackages:
  - `format.layout`: Layout-related formatters (BoxFormat, DividerFormat, TableFormat)
  - `format.progress`: Progress-related formatters (ProgressBarFormat, ProgressBarRunner)
  - `format.text`: Text-related formatters (BasicMessageFormat, MessageType)
- Kept `FormatFactory` and `VisualizationType` in the root format package

### Style Package
- Organized styling components in the `style` package:
  - Color components: ForegroundColor, BackgroundColor, RgbColor, Color256
  - Text style components: TextStyle
  - Style utilities: Style, StyleFormatter, StringDecorator
  - Base components: StyleComponent, AbstractStyleComponent

### Core Package
- Maintained the core package structure:
  - `core.file`: File-related components (PrettyFile, PrettyFileTreeNode)
  - `core.stream`: Stream-related components (PrettyPrintStream)

### Utils Package
- Kept utility classes in the `utils` package:
  - FileUtils
  - TerminalUtils
  - TextUtils

## Documentation
- Created `PACKAGE_STRUCTURE.md` to document the new package hierarchy
- Added package-level documentation to explain package responsibilities

## Benefits of the Changes
1. **Improved Organization**: The new package structure is more logical and easier to navigate.
2. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each package has a clear responsibility and purpose.
3. **Better Discoverability**: Related classes are grouped together, making it easier to find what you're looking for.
4. **Reduced Coupling**: Dependencies between packages are more explicit and controlled.
5. **Consistent Naming**: Naming conventions are consistent across the codebase.

## Next Steps
The next TODO items in the refactoring plan can now be implemented, building on the foundation of the reorganized package structure.
