# Changes Made to Satisfy TODO #1: Separate styling from layout components

## Overview
The first TODO item in the refactoring plan was to separate styling from layout components. This has been implemented by:

1. Creating a dedicated `style` package for styling components
2. Moving styling functionality from layout components to style-focused classes
3. Refactoring layout components to use the new style classes
4. Ensuring clean interfaces between styling and layout

## New Style Components

### Interfaces
- `StyleComponent`: Base interface for all styling components
- `AbstractStyleComponent`: Abstract base class implementing common functionality

### Style Classes
- `TextStyle`: Enum for text styles (bold, italic, etc.)
- `ForegroundColor`: Enum for foreground colors
- `BackgroundColor`: Enum for background colors
- `RgbColor`: Class for 24-bit RGB colors
- `Color256`: Class for 8-bit (256) colors
- `StyleFormatter`: Class for combining multiple style components
- `StringDecorator`: Class for fluent styling of strings
- `Style`: Utility class with static methods for styling

## Layout Components Updated
The following layout components have been updated to use the new style components:

- `BoxFormat`: Now uses `ForegroundColor` and `Style` instead of `PrettyStyle.Color` and `PrettyStyle.apply()`
- `DividerFormat`: Now uses `ForegroundColor` and `Style` instead of `PrettyStyle.Color` and `PrettyStyle.apply()`
- `TableFormat`: Now uses `ForegroundColor` and `Style` instead of `PrettyStyle.Color` and `PrettyStyle.apply()`

## Benefits of the Changes
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Styling and layout are now separate concerns, making the code more modular and maintainable.
2. **Improved Code Organization**: Styling functionality is now in a dedicated package, making it easier to find and use.
3. **Cleaner Interfaces**: Layout components now have cleaner interfaces that focus on layout concerns.
4. **Better Extensibility**: New styling components can be added without modifying layout components.
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Common styling functionality is now in shared base classes.

## Next Steps
The next TODO items in the refactoring plan can now be implemented, building on the foundation of separated styling and layout components.
